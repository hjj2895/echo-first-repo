Git Process

- Create a repo on github
- cloned the repo
  local - is your computer
  remote - Github (the cloud)
- cd into the repo
- make a file - touch filename with extension
    - naming conventions are lowercase, no spaces, use dashes between words
    - extension - what file type, ex: .md, .html, .js, .css
- added content to file
- added PAT authentication (generated a new personal authentication token on github)
Local --> Remote
    - git status
    - git add filename.ext
    - git commit -m "message"
    - git push origin branchname (we used main)
